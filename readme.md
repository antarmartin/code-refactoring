Homework Assignment 1: Refactoring

For our first assignment for the UCSD Extenstion Fullstack Bootcamp, we have been tasked with refactoring a website for semantics and accessibility. 

The reason for the refactoring is because the way the html file was written, it was written in such a way where it appears the way you would expect a website to appear, if we were only looking at just the visuals from the website. Behind the scenes, a lot of what structured the website was written with mostly div tags. Where the challenge comes in is we're tasked with changing the semantics while making the website appear as if no changes occured. 

There have been some changes made to the html code such as adding an aria-label to give a description to a background image embedded in the CSS file. The images in the section class were given a class of 'class="content-block"' because there was corresponding css code that adhered to the same structure, and there was also some css code that repeated the same structure, so the extra lines of code were deleted and then consolidated in the the proper id tags. The same thing took place with the 'aside class="benefits" and the images associated there. 

Please refer to the following images within the code-refactoring repository:

Please do offer me any comments, critiques, or any other constructive criticism that can be used to help me improve as a developer.

Thank you.
